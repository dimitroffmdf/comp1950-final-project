            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>We tried to divide up the work as evenly as we could. Milen started off the project and after a couple of things he did, we divided up the work accordingly.</p>

            <h2>Milen Dimitrov</h2>
            <p>After brainstorming with Mary, Milen started laying down the final project with some wireframe sketches for the protosite and started off the project with the markup and creation of the repo on github.</p> 
            <p>Milen was in charge of the skeleton of the protosite as well the basic CSS to go along with it. Details below:</p>

            <ol>
               <li>Start project: HTML for home page, and basic style - Started off the project by doing the HTML for the protosite homepage and basic CSS to go along with the markup</li>
               <li>Protosite quiz page - and php script</li>
               <li>Protosite lecture and about pages - Reasoning: since he did the HTML markup for two protosite pages at this point, we decided that he should do the rest of the markup for the lecture and about pages as he is most familiar with the work he did</li>
               <li>Protosite content - Content for the COMP1950 pages</li>
               <li>Protosite print style</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Mary Do</h2>
            <p>Because Milen had already started and finished a couple HTML pages for the protosite, it only made sense for Mary to do the metasite and to complete the remainder of the CSS for the protosite.</p>

            <ol>
               <li>Protosite CSS styles. Milen had the basic CSS done to go with the markup; Mary edited the CSS to make it more presentable. Fonts, colours, links, hover styles, gradients, etc.</li>
               <li>Extra editing and fixes - There were things to be fixed in the markup and CSS, as well as fixing file paths since she was in charge of the sitemap and second stage of CSS</li>
               <li>Protosite projector style - Made the most sense for Mary to do as she is doing the second stage of CSS for the protosite</li>
               <li>Metasite HTML and CSS</li>
               <li>Metasite content - Write ups for introduction and rationale, and sitemap</li>
            </ol>
