         <h1>Rationale</h1>
         
         <h2>Layout</h2>
         <p>Our goal of this project was to improve on the design and user interface while keeping all of the same elements of the original COMP1950 website. It was a bit of a challenge figuring out how and where to display all of the useful elements. How we settled on the layout was thinking about what students--like ourselves--want to see and what we want fast access to.</p>
         
         <p>We based our thoughts on the lecture pages, as that's where the majority of students will be spending time on and where the bulk of the content is. What did we want to see generally? The current class lecture notes, exercises, homework <em>and</em> fast access to <strong>other weekly lectures</strong>. We liked how the original site lists the weekly classes on the sidebar. It's easy to see what each class is about and gives fast access to switching between weekly class lectures/notes, so we decided to keep a similar feature in our layout.</p>
         
         <p>We liked the feature of the sidebar so much that we wanted to expand on it even more. We thought about how each class is laid out. During each class we have several agendas go over with exercises scattered throughout, a quiz at the beginning of class, and a homework assigned at the end. This is the general pattern for each lecture, so we decided that <em>the sidebar for each lecture</em> should contain the following: a quiz at the top of the list, followed by the agendas of the class, class exercises (including a zipped folder with class exercises of the week for easy download), as well as a link to the homework PDF at the end of the list. Many of these sidebar links are bookmarks, which makes it easy for students to jump to whatever topic or exercise they need at hand. This is what the sidebar navigation contains for the lecture pages and what we believe is optimal for user experience. As for the actual content of the lectures, we believe it should stay the same as the original site, as that's how the lectures are done and keeping in the same order makes the most sense.</p>
         
         <p>We also noticed that as a student, we wouldn't mind having a convenient download all option for exercises. Furthermore, quizzes always occurred at the beginning of class, and homework always assigned at the end. This was reflected in the lecture page sidebar with the quiz always being at the very top, homework at the end, and also a handy download all zip folder for exercises just above the homework.</p>
         
         <p>Now that we have the lecture pages sorted out, we also had to deal with the general links like home, about, resources, lectures, and contact. On the original site, there was only a single sidebar navigation. It was a bit difficult sorting out the details, but eventually we came to the conclusion that these links should have its own navigation bar at the top which is separate from lecture specific things on the sidebar.</p>

         <p>In summary, the main navigation contains general links; the sidebar navigation is lecture specific. On lecture pages, the sidebar nav contains all the things pertinent to the weekly lecture. On the homepage, the sidebar nav lists the weekly lectures.</p>
         
         
         <h2>Colours</h2>
         <p>The base colours of the site are varying shades of grey with a couple shades of Persian Green. Here is a <a href="https://coolors.co/05a8aa-4c5454-2d2a32-ffffff-eeec94" target="_blank">swatch of the colours</a> that were used on the protosite. We wanted to keep the same sense of professionalism as the original. Grey is a neutral colour and works well on most websites. The Persian Green is more of a blue-green colour. Blue is a colour used on many corporate websites; it is commonly associated with tranquility, reliability, and security. Both blue and green are favourites of both genders and are gender neutral colours. A splash of yellow was also added to brighten up the site, and complements the Persian Green.</p>
         
         <h2>CSS3</h2>
         <p>We kept the website fairly simple but implemented a few CSS3 techniques, particularly the linear-gradient, transitions, border-radius, and opacity (rgba) just to add a bit of visual appeal to the site.</p>
         
         <h2>Scripts</h2>
         <p>As mentioned earlier, the weekly quiz can now be accessed at the top of the lecture pages, meaning no more paper quizzes and there is a script to process it.</p>

         <h2>Summary of Improvements</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Visually more appealing</li>
            <li>Demonstrates usage of CSS3 (since it is a class for web development &amp; design)</li>
            <li>Sidebar in lecture pages outlines the class agenda and is a quick jump-to navigation - We believe this is a major improvement in the structure</li>
            <li>Paperless quiz that can be accessed at the top of each sidebar in lecture pages (since it's the first thing that occurs in class)</li>
            <li>In lecture pages, there is now a download all exercises link in the sidebar -- easy to download all exercises in a single zip folder rather than scrolling through and downloading one at a time</li>
            <li>Mobile-friendly for the times we want to study on the bus or on an alternate device</li>
            <li>Projector friendly (alternate stylesheet)</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h2>Future Implementations</h2>
         <p>Something we want to have done in the future (i.e. a current challenge) is a way to ensure a closed-book quiz that's done in the browser. An idea would be having a pop-up window that's covering the screen for the quizzes, and scripted with a way to prevent students from alt-tabbing or switching between tabs/windows.</p>
